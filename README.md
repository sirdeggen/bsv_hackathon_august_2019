# Ask The World

https://asktheworld.net/

Ask the world is a service for asking questions and getting answers.

It provides a way for new users to Earn Bitcoin, while also doing the right thing - sharing information.

# Incentives

The right incentives change everything.

- AskTheWorld has very low entry barriers, and we can make them even lower
  - No wallet needed on registration.
  - Address is only needed if you are replying
  - Rewarding answers to your questions requires MoneyButton right now. This is the biggest barrier we have.

- AskTheWorld motivates people to share valuable information
  - instead of putting barriers in front of information, we motivate people with a potential reward, but ONLY if the question author approves the answer.
  - "Information wants to be valued." - Someone Very Smart

- To deal with possible question authors who never pay what they promised, we use reputation as an incentive
  - But reputation is hard to measure. It is complex. It is subjective.
  - Instead, we simply present the history of the user and let others draw their own conclusions.
  - Unpaid questions, underpaid ones, overpaid ones... all will be visible from the profile.

# Goals

- Entry gate for new users
- Useful site even for non-users
- Incentivize people to do good.
